# Dissertation: Generation and Evaluation of High-Fidelity Synthetic Biomarker Data for Alzheimer’s Disease Research

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation associated with my Bachelor's dissertation titled "Generation and Evaluation of High-Fidelity Synthetic Biomarker Data for Alzheimer’s Disease Research". 
The research focuses on generating high-fidelity synthetic datasets for Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment biomarkers using advanced generative models, aiming to develop and validate a novel, extensible evaluation framework to rigorously benchmark synthetic-data generators in biomedical contexts and accelerate reliable, reproducible advances in AD/MCI diagnostics and predictive modeling.
